Automatic Program Simplification
********************************

Pysh currently supports a very simplistic version of Automatic Program Synthesis. This will be changing in the near future.

If you want an explaination of how this works, bug me on the `Pysh GitHub <https://github.com/erp12/Pysh>`_! Maybe open an `issue <https://github.com/erp12/Pysh/issues>`_ about it. :)

If you would like to read more about Automatic Program Simplifiction of push programs in general, including what is used in other implemenations, see `this page of the Push Redux <https://erp12.github.io/push-redux/pages/simplification/index.html>`_.
